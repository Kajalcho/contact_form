A brief description of what this project does and who it's for
Contact Form HTML Template
This repository contains a simple HTML template for a contact form designed to collect user information and messages.

Features
User-friendly Interface: The form has a clean and intuitive design, making it easy for users to input their information and submit messages.

Basic Validation: The form includes basic validation for required fields (name, email, and message) to ensure that users provide necessary information before submission.

Integration with Web3Forms API: Upon submission, the form sends the collected data to the Web3Forms API for processing. This integration allows you to receive form submissions directly to your specified email address.

Usage
HTML Structure: The structure of the contact form is defined in the Contact.html file. It consists of input fields for name, email, and message, along with a submit button.

Styling: The visual appearance of the contact form is defined in the style.css file. You can customize the styles (such as colors, fonts, and layout) according to your preferences by modifying this file.

Submitting Data: When a user fills out the form and submits it, the data is sent to the Web3Forms API for processing. The API access key is included as a hidden input field in the form.

Setup
Obtain API Access Key: To use the Web3Forms API for form submission, you need to obtain an API access key. Sign up on the Web3Forms platform to get your unique access key.

Configuration: Replace the placeholder value of the access_key input field in the HTML (index.html) with your actual Web3Forms API access key. This allows the form to authenticate with the API and submit data successfully.

Customization: Customize the form fields, styles, and other elements according to your requirements. You can modify the HTML and CSS files to match the branding and design preferences of your website or application.

Image Assets: Ensure that the paths specified for the image assets (right_img.png and arrow_icon.png) in the HTML file are correct and that the corresponding images exist in the specified location within your project directory.
